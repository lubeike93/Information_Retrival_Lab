The Practical Exercise for thr University Course for Information Retrieval in High Dimensional Data

Course Description: 

An overview of applications and a very basic method of dimensionality reduction, the linear principle component analysis, we investigate modern methods and their field of applications. 

-Decisions from Data
-Curse of Dimensionality
-From Phenomena to Data
-Logistic Regression
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-Linear Discriminant Analysis
-Support Vector Machines
-Kernel PCA
-Feedforward Neural Networks

At the end of the lecture, students understand several state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and data analysis techniques and are able to implement them into Python.

The application examples will mainly be based on either image processing or natural language processing tasks, since they provide a paradigm for analyzing high dimensional data.
